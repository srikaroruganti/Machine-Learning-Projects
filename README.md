# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo will contain all the machine learning projects I will do.

## 1. Google playstore analysis:
  This project carries out the analysis of the data scrapped from playstore and uses it to 
answer the following questions:
 * Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
 * Is any specific category dominating the market?
 * Which categories have the fewest number of apps?
 * Does the size of an app affect its rating?
 * Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
 * Does the price of an app affect its rating?
 * Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
